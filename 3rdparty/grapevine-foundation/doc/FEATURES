FEATURES
========

Future ideas
 - Soft-body physics Integration
 - Skeletal animation
 - Audio API
 - Scripting (AngelScript/Squirrel/LUA/JavaScript)
 - Some "Privates" could be named to be "Referenced"
 - Some non-privates could be straightly inherited from ReferencedPointer

v2.0 (on-going)
 - Vector and bitmap font available as extension
 - C++11 support
 - Meta bariables and binding (js like "ad-hoc" functions)
 - JS bindings
 
v1.2
 - Input's to SceneExtensions
 - Extend the current vector font implementation to separate library

v1.1
 - Box based culler for simple application scenes
 - Performance updates

v1.0
 - Rearrange algorithm
 - Omnilight API
 - Device orientation API
 - Removed Bullet physics (physics will be a separate library always in future)

v0.0.6
 - Scene + SceneExtensions, new extendable scene API and default extensions
 - Animation API, LinearPath, BezierPath + Easing curves to Math
 - State Machine
 - Arrange API for grids
 - DynamicMesh to create bendable rectangular meshes

v0.0.5
 - Physics rigid integration
 - IPC classes
 - Automatic shader selection based on material

v0.0.4
 - specular, bumpmap, cube map reflection
 - dynamic texture

v0.0.3
 - 3ds max FBX to barrel convert tool: single mesh FBX to .barrel format exporter
 - GPU shader based font engine (kaski, .ttf load)

v0.0.2
