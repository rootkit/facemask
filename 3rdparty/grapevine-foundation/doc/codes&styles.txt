Codes & Styles
==============

# Abstract classes
 - Place "Abstract" in the front of the name of the class.
 - Place Constructor and Destructor to protected side.


# Uncopyable & unassignable
Inherit from Uncopyable class found under Grapevine/Core/


# PIMPL
The desclare the private part use "class YourClass* private_" in the header
file. Core/Class.hpp has some helper defines to make it more clear that we are
using the PIMPL. These defines are CREATE_PRIVATE and FREE_PRIVATE. Use them
like next:

CREATE_PRIVATE(your class Constructor(parameter1, parameter2, ...)) to create
    private_ variable.

FREE_PRIVATE in the destructor to free the created private_ variable


# Header only classes
If the class is dead simple, for example simple base getter setter class, you
can do it as header only class (no .cpp file)


# Mutex and Lock
Use mutex_ variable name for Mutex class if possible. Then you can use LOCK
define to lock the code block.
